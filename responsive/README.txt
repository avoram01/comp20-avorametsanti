Lab 4: Responsive Design
README.txt

I was able to display the comic strip by each comic by creating a CSS file that
displays a certain part of the gif file provided depending on the browser size.
Initially, I tried to break up the image into multiple classes, but I was unable
to do so successfully. I tried again, this time creating a single class that 
included the whole picture, and then creating media queries that depended on the 
size of the browser, which determines which part of the gif to display.

Jack Collins helped me approach the assignment from a different perspective (
having one class and displaying different parts of the gif as opposed to having 
many classes).

I spent about 2 hours on this lab.
