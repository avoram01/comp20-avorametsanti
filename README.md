1. The purpose of this repository is to back up my work. This is useful
in case I lose my files on my local machine or I need to backtrack in my work.

2. My favorite assignment was the first assignment because it was the first
time I saw a tangible result from my coding. It excited me that I could 
physically see what I had coded on a real web page on the Internet.

3. I have grown considerably from the first day of this class. I am now
familiar with 3 other coding languages, as well as several programs used in web
programming. In addition, I have been exposed to a part of computer science that
is not taught in COMP11 and COMP15. I learned that coding is very dynamic and can
be as simple or as complicated as you want your product to be.

4. The first thing I learned from this class is that nobody knows everything.
Computer science is such a diverse field consisting of a multitude of different
areas of concentrations that are constantly growing and changing. It is 
impossible to know everything - the key is asking for help and researching. The
second thing I learned in this class is that the process of creating a working
program is not just coding and debugging. It also includes researching how
to use outside programs to develop your own and thinking about how different
parts of you programs will work together. The process of developing your
program gets easier as you understand how all the different parts of your program
will function independently and together.


5. I really liked learning about web programming in general and I would like
to practice creating more content. I feel like this class has given me an 
introduction to front-end development and I would like to learn more about it
in general.
