Assignment 4: Security and Privacy Assessment
README.txt

I identified and analyzed 3 security and privacy issues with Aaron Epstein's project, which is what is required of this assignment. However, there are still issues that I have not identified because nothing is perfect.

Jack Collins and Brandon Voelz helped me come up with possible issues in my partner's code.

I spent about 3 hours on this assignment.
