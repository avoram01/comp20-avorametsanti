Lab 5: Closed Captioning
README.txt

I was able to add captions to the video by adding an eventListener that listed
to the "timeupdate" event. I wrote an anonymous function that checked the 
currentTime of the video to determine which lyric to display. I displayed the 
lyric by grabbing the "lyric" ID from the document and changing the innerHTML.

Brendan Voelz (TA) helped me figure out syntax and Kenny helped me understand how to dynamically change a page with Javascript.

I spent about 2 hours on this lab.
