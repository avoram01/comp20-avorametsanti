Assignment 2: Historic Landmarks
README.md

In this assignment, I was able to receive my location in latitude/longitude by 
using navigator.geolocation and sent my location to the datastore. I received
the locations of other people and of nearby landmarks and displayed them as 
markers on my map by parsing the JSON file sent from the server. In addition,
I displayed the distance away of the other markers from my own location when
those markers are clicked. I also created a polyline between my location and
the nearest landmark.

Philip Wang helped me fix my icons and KiKi Chan helped me understand asynchronous
timing and how to use callback functions.

I spent about 5 hours on this project.
