Lab 6: Captain's Log
README.md

I displayed messages by using an event listener that listened for a return key 
press. Upon pressing return, the inputted message and the date is displayed in 
the log below. In addition, previous messages from other visits to the page are 
displayed having been stored in local storage. The messages are displayed with 
the most recent on top.

I did not collaborate with anybody on this project.

I spent about 2 hours on this project.
